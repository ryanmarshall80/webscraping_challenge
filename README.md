Ryan Marshall Homework 12 Repository

This repository should contain three separate files. Two jupyter source files: homework12_part1 that contains the completed part 1 for web scraping the mars news site, and homework12_part2 that contains the completed part 2 for web scraping the mars temperature site with analysis. There's also a marstemps.csv, which is the csv file I exported in part 2 of the assignment.
