# webscraping_challenge
Ryan Marshall Homework 12 Repository

This repository should contain three separate files. Two jupyter source files: part_1_mars_news that contains the completed part 1 for web scraping the mars news site, and part_2_mars_weather that contains the completed part 2 for web scraping the mars temperature site with analysis. There's also a marstemps.csv, which is the csv file I exported in part 2 of the assignment.
